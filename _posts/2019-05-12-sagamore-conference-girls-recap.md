# Headlines

## Usual Suspects Anchor Scoring

Lexi Odum finished with the highest placing on the evening for the lady Mounties. Lexi ran a season best in the 200m Dash for the 2nd place runner up spot. Lexi also ran to a third place finish behind Lebanon's dynamic sprint duo of Montgomery & Funk.

Shannon Isenberg does what she always does, and secured vital points in the 100m and 300m Hurdles finishing third in both behind Division I bound opponents.

Emma Ward wrapped up the usual scoring for the Mounties with her 4th place finish in the Pole Vault.

## 4x100 Relay Record In Danger...

The girls 4x100 relay squad had a brush with history Friday night. The girls ran a near perfect race, securing 2nd place to Lebanon. Their time of 51.59 was close to edging the record set in 1985 (51.38) by legendary runners Tracy Kinkead, Stacy Williams, Amy Huckstep and Denise Harvey. The ladies have another shot at the record with some amazing competition at the Zionsville Sectional. Will they be able to secure a piece of history?

## Throwers Step Up

Much like the boys side, our throwers had big personal bests on the evening. Lexi Nelson was the throws point score leader, finishing 4th in Discus with a lifetime personal best. In the Shot Put, Sydney Phillips nabbed a point for the Mounties with an 8th place finish and a personal best. Abbi Benge also had a season best throw for a 12th place finish.

## Personal Bests Abound

Mia Myers had an amazing 100m finals race, running a personal best and finishing 5th in the Conference. HUSTLE FASTER, MYERS!

Suzi Pedro went beast mode and secured a 4th place finish in the 400m Dash _(a field that is deeply stacked, and saw two girls at 1 minute or below)_. She improved on her seed greatly. Suzi also had a personal best in the Long Jump at 12'11".

## **Honorable Mentions:**

**Cari Strasburger:** Cari had a great 800m race, and finished with a lifetime personal best of 2:51.92. Cari also ran a strong anchor leg in the 4x400 (1:08).

**Addison Charles:** Addison set a seasons best in the 1600m Run, running a strong and confident race and finished in 10th. She looks to improve on her time this week.

**Tiffany Dittmer:** The freshman hurdler overcame an early week injury to her arm to compete well in both 100m/300m hurdle events. Tiffany finished in 9th place in both events, just outside scoring potential. I was very proud with how she rebounded and competed. TO THE MOON, TIFF!
