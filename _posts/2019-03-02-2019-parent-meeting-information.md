* Help with concessions during the Indoor Conference Meet

## Pre-Meet Snacks

* Work Home Track Meets
* To attend the end of the year banquet.
* Communication Coaches Expect From Parents
* Concerns should be expressed directly to the head coach, not assistant coaches.  If there is a concern please wait at least one hour after a game or a practice.  If it is still a concern at this point, please contact the head coach.
* Notify the head coach of any schedule conflicts well in advance.

## Appropriate Concerns to Discuss with Head Coach

* The treatment of your child.
* Ways to help your child improve.
* Concerns about your child’s behavior.
* Limitations & Restrictions from Dr. - Clear & Specific!
* **Understand that all our coaches are professionals.  We will make judgment decisions on what we believe is in the interest of the program.**  

## **Issues Not Appropriate to Discuss with Coaches**

* Team Strategy
* Other Student-Athletes
* Mr. Charles (Athletic Director)
* **If there is a situation that does require a conference, please schedule a conference with the head coach.  Please refer to the Parent / Coach Communication from the Athletic policy.**

## Pre-Meet Snacks

For both Home and Away meets, we would like to able to provide our athletes with a snack of some sort. This typically includes a sandwich, chips, something sweet, and a bottle of water.  Please let me know if there is a parent(s) that would like to spearhead our Pre-Meet Snacks.   

## Fundraising  

**Our fundraiser is during the Indoor Sagamore Conference Meet.**  Everyone needs to do their part to make this possible and successful!  That includes providing food items, having parents working the concession stand the day of the Meet, etc.  Please let me know if there is a parent(s) that would like to spearhead our fundraiser.

Please Sign Up to donate Concession Items.  

We will also sell Apparel from Fan Cloth.

## Riding Home with Parents

**An athlete may ride home with their parents after the end of a competition if your parent has completed the Travel Release Form.** In addition athletes will not be allowed to ride home with friends.  They may ride home with another adult, but we must have written record of this prior to the meet, and that adult must fill out the Travel Release Form.

## Volunteers for Home Meets

Like any Track program, we depend upon volunteers to help us out with meets.  We will be asking parents to help us run events at Home Meets.  If you cannot provide snacks or help us with the Fundraiser, this is a great way to help out.  

**Home Meets** - April 18th TW, April 23rd Leb. / Webo, May 3rd County  - We will need ticket takers, timers, and people to work the different events.

## **Indoor Conference Meet**

We’ll need the following spots filled with volunteers: x2 Ticket Takers, x4 Concession Stand Workers, x2 HJ Workers.
