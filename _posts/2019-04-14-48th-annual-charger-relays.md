# Headlines

## Boys 4x400 & 4x100 Dominant

Fun to win, especially with scintillating finishes by Dillan Lauy on both teams.

Trent Jones, Cameron Giles, Nathan France & Dillan Lauy teamed up to blow away the field uncontested in both the sprint relays.

4x400 - 3:33.01 / 4x100 - 45.97

All four boys ran season best splits into a heavy wind. The 400m split averages are the second fastest we've seen in past 20+ years for four guys. And it's only April.

## Girls Shuttle Hurdle Retain Crown

The girls Shuttle hurdle looked to defend their title as champions, and they did not disappoint. Long sprint specialist Suzi Pedro stepped up to serve as the critical fourth leg, and the team cruised to victory behind the hurdling prowess of Shannon Isenberg, Mia Myers, and Tiffany Dittmer.

While not a record breaking performance, Isenberg and Dittmer received plenty of "WHOA'S" from the crowd at large.

## **Boy's Long Jump Duo Second by Inches**

Dillan Lauy had the best long jump of all individuals on the night at 20' 10.5". Trent Jones teamed up with him, popping off an 18' 7.5" effort. The boys combined for a total of 39' 6" behind North Montgomery's duo of Kade Kobel and Ben Lovold who went a combined 39' 8.5".

## Girls 4x200 & 4x400 Second in Close Races

The ladies had their hands full in both these races. Girls lead the 4x200 until the anchor leg. Benton Central goes 1:53.13 / Southmont 1:53.91.

In the 4x400, #1 runner Shannon Isenberg ran a lifetime personal best split to open things off and grant the Mounties the lead. Suzi Pedro battled during second leg against a strong North Montgomery #2 runner. Lexie Odum closed out the race with a valiant effort but was unable to close the gap with North Montgomery in time.

North Montgomery 4:20.57 / Southmont 4:24.10.

Still searching for our 4th runner to take this 4x400 group from good to great.

## Boys Discus Duo 4th with Season Bests

Jamie Freeman and Zion Essex stepped up for a fourth place finish. Both boys had season best throws. Freeman went 111' 1" and Essex was 102' 2" 

## Young Distance Crew Improving

The boys ran the 4x800 without #1 runner Thomas Richardson. The boys were still able to crack 10 minutes in the 4x800 (9:59.16). Three boys improved their split times. Austin Smothers, Logan Phillips, Cale Hess. Future is looking brighter for distance.

## Lack of Focus Takes Toll

Mishaps that could have been avoided occurred on both boys and girls sides.

The mens 4x200 team was poised as a favorite. A failed handoff sank hopes of a victory and a shot at the school record.

The women's 4x100 team was similarly a contender for the primary spot. Another failed handoff between #3 and #4 runners dashed hopes of what would have been an electric finish with Northview and Benton Central.

We will reset and reload for next week, with an emphasis on meet preparation!
