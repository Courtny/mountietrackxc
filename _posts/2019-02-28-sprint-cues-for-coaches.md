title: Sprint Cues for Coaches
---
Each season we seem to have new staff, either at the high school or middle school level.

We've put together our most common sprint cues for teaching your athletes proper sprint mechanics.

1. **“Run tall”** - Great runners run with perfect posture _(shoulders back, abs tight, hips forward)_ … this is our #1 verbal cue … knee lift and glute recruitment requires tall posture. _"5’10” sprinters run at 6’0”"_
2. **“Foot in front”** - The lead foot must get high and in front of the hips to create vertical force. 
3. **“Fast and loose”** - Great sprinters make it look easy … practice making sprinting look effortless.
4. **“Hammer back”** - Arms at 90 degrees … short levers = fast levers … lengthen on back stroke … elbow high on backswing … I really don’t say “hammer back” often … the next cue is my go-to.
5. **“Cross the hips”** - Open palms cross the hips, (I say this constantly!) 
6. **“Heel up, knee up, toe up”** - Dorsi-flexed foot is imperative _(like a loaded spring)_ – short lever, calf activation, minimizes ground contact.
