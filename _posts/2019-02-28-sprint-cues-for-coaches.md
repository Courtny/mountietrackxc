Each season we seem to have new staff, either at the high school or middle school level. Often they are volunteers and perhaps unfamiliar with Track & Field. To help work them into our sprint training, we've put together our most common sprint cues for teaching your athletes proper sprint mechanics.

## Top 6 Sprint Cues

1. **“Run tall”** - Great runners run with perfect posture _(shoulders back, abs tight, hips forward)_ … this is our #1 verbal cue … knee lift and glute recruitment requires tall posture. _"5’10” sprinters run at 6’0”"_
2. **“Foot in front”** - The lead foot must get high and in front of the hips to create vertical force.
3. **“Fast and loose”** - Great sprinters make it look easy … practice making sprinting look effortless.
4. **“Hammer back”** - Arms at 90 degrees … short levers = fast levers … lengthen on back stroke … elbow high on backswing … I really don’t say “hammer back” often … the next cue is my go-to.
5. **“Cross the hips”** - Open palms cross the hips, (I say this constantly!)
6. **“Heel up, knee up, toe up”** - Dorsi-flexed foot is imperative _(like a loaded spring)_ – short lever, calf activation, minimizes ground contact.
