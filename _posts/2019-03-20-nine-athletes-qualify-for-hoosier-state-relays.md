Nine members of the Southmont track and field team qualified to compete in 6 events at the 2019 IATCCC Hoosier State Relays held in Bloomington, Indiana.

The top 24 track, long jump & shot and top 18 high jump & pole vault in each division are eligible to qualify for the state meet. Southmont competes in the Small School division, comprised of 1A-3A sized schools.

The boys & girls 4x200 relay teams are poised to attempt another shot at the record books this weekend. The boys 4x200 of Cameron Giles, Ty Welliever, Trent Jones and Evan Hedge are seeded 13th. The girls team currently sits in 18th and will have another run against rival Danville, who edged them at the Sagamore Conference meet in the finals.

Takeshi Greiner, Emma Ward, Lexie Odum, Trent Jones, and Shannon Isenberg will all be representing Southmont in individual events as well.

Takeshi Greiner enters the 60m Hurdles seeded 16th. Emma Ward sits tied for 14th in Pole Vault. Lexie Odum is 23rd in the 60m Dash, while Trent Jones is in the 24th spot. Both are looking for a chance to improve their seed positions and move up in the rankings in the short sprint.

Shannon Isenberg rounds out the field of nine as the highest individually ranked competitor for the Mounties. She is competing in the 60m Hurdles with a 15th place seed.

This is the final indoor meet of the season, and is widely regarded as the Indiana Indoor State Championships.
