# Headlines

## Mounties Dominate Long Sprints

Dillan Lauy, Trent Jones, and Nathan France put a stranglehold on the 200m and 400m races. Super freshman Jones was Conference Champion in the 200m Dash, and pulled out a 3rd place finish in the 100m Dash.

The highlight of the evening for the sprint crew was the double hammer performance of Dillan Lauy (Champion) and Nathan France (Runner-Up) in the 400m Dash. The Mountie quarter milers were able to hold off challengers from Lebanon in the closing 100 meters of the race.

I call Dillan "Batman". He can do anything, he's Mr Utility. He also secured the Champion spot in Pole Vault and placed 3rd in Long Jump.

The boys 4x400 relay team of Jones, France, Lauy and Cameron Giles did what they have all season and dominated the competition to become conference champions.

## Throwers Step Up

Our throwers had big personal bests on the evening. Zion Essex led the way for the Mountie throwing crew, placing an inspired second in the Shot Put. Jamie Freeman and Jud VanCleave clawed their way to a 5th and 8th place finish in the discus.

## Hurdlers Double-up Personal Bests

Takeshi Greiner and Jake Whitecotton continued their strong seasons, both running personal bests. Greiner secured a 3rd place finish in the 110 hurdles, and 5th in the 300m with a PR. Jake Whitecotton ran a strong race for a PR in the 110 hurdles for 5th, and secured a 3rd place finish in the 300m Hurdles.

## Veteran Harrier Richardson Stands Alone

Thomas Richardson was out to prove something his senior year in the Conference. He did not go out without a fight. Thomas contributed two hard nosed races to secure a 6th place finish in the 3200m Run and 8th in the 1600m Run. Both finishes came down to sprints in the final moments.

## **Honorable Mentions:**

**Cale Hess:** A fifth place finish in Pole Vault (10'). Personal record in the 1600m (5:16.81), finishing 12th. Another young guy figuring out how to race and exploring what Track & Field is about. Performs under clutch situations. No experience running distance or vaulting. A great athlete with a high ceiling.

**Cameron Giles:** Our #2 leg of the 4x400. A 5'9" 190lb, hard nosed football running back. We converted him this year to a sprint specialist. We've seen a lot of progress in his race modeling. Went 61 seconds last season in 400m. Now splitting 53 seconds in a 400m. Dropped 100m time from 13.5 to 11.8. Watch out this fall.

**Zane Mason:** Dropped a personal record in the Shot Put (37'2"). Young guys improving always makes coach happy.

**Logan Phillips:** Hard Fought, placed 13th in 800m **(2:24.73)**. He has really come along this year as a freshman. A tenacious worker and a leader for the future of the distance squad.

Boys 4x800: **Ryan Sowers, Connor Keller, Austin Smothers, Logan Phillips.** I expected to get 8th place. Our boys pulled out 7th (10:01.54). And they set a personal record for their relay squad.
