## Headlines

# Mounties Dominate Long Sprints

Dillan Lauy, Trent Jones, and Nathan France put a stranglehold on the 200m and 400m races. Super freshman Jones was Conference Champion in the 200m Dash, and pulled out a 3rd place finish in the 100m Dash.

The highlight of the evening for the sprint crew was the double hammer performance of Dillan Lauy (Champion) and Nathan France (Runner-Up) in the 400m Dash. The Mountie quarter milers were able to hold off challengers from Lebanon and Tri-West in the closing 100 meters of the race.

**Honorable Mentions:**

**Cale Hess:** A fifth place finish in Pole Vault (10'). Personal record in the 1600m (5:16.81), finishing 12th. Another young guy figuring out how to race and exploring what Track & Field is about. Performs under clutch situations. No experience running distance or vaulting. A great athlete with a high ceiling.

**Cameron Giles:** Our #2 leg of the 4x400. A 5'9" 190lb, hard nosed football running back. We converted him this year to a sprint specialist. We've seen a lot of progress in his race modeling. Went 61 seconds last season in 400m. Now splitting 53 seconds in a 400m. Dropped 100m time from 13.5 to 11.8. Watch out this fall.

**Zane Mason:** Dropped a personal record in the Shot Put (37'2"). Young guys improving always makes coach happy.

**Logan Phillips:** Hard Fought, placed 9th in 800m **\*\*(2:24.73)**.\*\* He has really come along this year as a freshman. A tenacious worker and a leader for the future of the distance squad.

Boys 4x800: **Ryan Sowers, Connor Keller, Austin Smothers, Logan Phillips.** I expected to get 8th place. Our boys pulled out 7th (10:01.54). And they set a personal record for their relay squad.
